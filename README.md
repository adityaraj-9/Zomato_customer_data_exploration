# Zomato_customer_data_exploration

In this project i have done data exploration using MS SQL Server on a dummy data for a food delivery company called Zomato.

Working on the data, i have answered following questions:
1. What is the total amount each customer spent on Zomato?
2. How many days has each customer visited Zomato?
3. What was the first product purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item in the menu and how many times it was purchased by each customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total order and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. A customer gets certain cashback in their Zomato wallet for their purchase points(5rs = 2 Zomato points).
   Each product have different purchasing points (p1 : 5rs = 1 Zomato point, p2 : 10rs = 5 Zomato point, p3 : 5rs = 1 Zomato point).
   a. Calculate the points collected by each customer and
   b. For which product most point have been given till now?
10. In one year after the customer joins the gold program(including the join date) irrespective of what customer has purchased they earn 5 Zomato
    points for every Rs10 they spent(Rs2 = 1 Zomato points). Who earned more points between customer 1 and 3 and how many points they earned?
11. Rank all the transaction of the customer based on purchase date for each customer.
12. Rank all the transactions for each member whenever they are a Zomato gold member and for every non-gold member mark transaction as N/A.
